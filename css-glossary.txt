Question 1: what are the three ways to apply CSS to an HTML page?
Junior Engineer Response:  
There are "three main ways" to apply CSS to an HTML page:  

1. Inline CSS: Applied directly to an HTML element using the "style" attribute.  
2. Internal CSS: Written inside a "<style>" tag within the "<head>" section of the HTML file.  
3. External CSS: Stored in a separate ".css" file and linked using the "<link>" tag.  

Example for Each Method:
Inline CSS:
<p style="color: blue; font-size: 18px;">This is a paragraph with inline CSS.</p>

Internal CSS:
<style>
  p {
    color: red;
    font-size: 20px;
  }
</style>

External CSS:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">

Mid-Level Engineer Response: 
CSS can be applied to a webpage in three ways, each with **advantages and drawbacks**:  

1. Inline CSS  
   - Applied directly using the `style` attribute on elements.  
   - Best for: Quick fixes, overriding other styles, email templates.  
   - Downside: Hard to maintain, reduces code reusability.  
   - Example:
     <button style="background-color: green; color: white;">Click Me</button>
     
2. Internal CSS (Embedded CSS) 
   - Defined within the `<style>` tag inside `<head>`.  
   - Best for: Small projects, one-page websites, or styling specific pages differently.  
   - Downside: Harder to maintain for large projects.  
   - Example:  
     <head>
       <style>
         body {
           background-color: lightgray;
           font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
         }
       </style>
     </head>

3. External CSS  
   -Stored separately in a ".css" file and linked using "<link>".  
   -Best for: Large projects, consistency across multiple pages, easy maintenance.  
   -Downside: Requires an extra HTTP request to load the CSS file.  
   -Example:
     <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
     
     styles.css
     h1 {
       color: navy;
       text-align: center;
     }
    

Question 2: what is css?
Junior Engineer Response:  
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a "stylesheet language" 
used to style and layout web pages. It controls how HTML elements appear on the screen by defining properties like colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning.

Example:
p {
  color: blue;
  font-size: 18px;
}
This makes all "<p>" elements blue and 18px in size.


Mid-Level Engineer Response:
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a "design language" at enhances the presentation of HTML content by controlling styles, layouts, and responsiveness. It **separates content from design**, making web pages more visually appealing and easier to maintain.

Key Features of CSS:
1. **Selectors & Properties** – Target elements and define their styles.  
2. **Cascading & Inheritance** – Resolves conflicting styles by following a priority order.  
3. **Box Model** – Defines spacing, margins, borders, and padding around elements.  
4. **Flexbox & Grid** – Provides modern layout techniques for responsive design.  

Example:
 External CSS file
body {
  background-color: #f4f4f4;
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}

h1 {
  color: navy;
  text-align: center;
}
This applies a light gray background, uses Arial font, and centers the heading with a navy color.
