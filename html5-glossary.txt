Question 1: What is the purpose of the `alt` attribute in images?

 Junior Engineer Response:
The `alt` attribute in images is used to provide alternative text that 
describes the image. This text is displayed if the image fails to load and 
is also used by screen readers to help visually impaired users understand the content. It improves accessibility and SEO.
Example:
<img src="logo.png" alt="Company logo">
If `logo.png` doesn’t load, the text "Company logo" will be shown instead.


Mid-Level Engineer Response:
The `alt` attribute serves multiple purposes:
1. Accessibility: Screen readers use the `alt` text to describe images for visually impaired users.
2. SEO Optimization: Search engines index `alt` text, improving a website’s ranking.
3. Fallback Content: If an image fails to load, the `alt` text provides context.

Best practices include writing descriptive yet concise `alt` text, avoiding redundant words like “image of,” and skipping it for decorative images.

Example:
<img src="graph.png" alt="Line graph showing sales growth from 2020 to 2024">
This ensures users understand the image's purpose even if they can’t see it.


Question 2: Explain the `meta` tags in HTML5?
Junior Engineer Response:
Meta tags in HTML5 are used to provide metadata about a webpage. They go inside the "<head>" section and help with SEO, page descriptions, viewport settings, and character encoding.  

Example:
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
<meta name="description" content="This is a website about technology news">
<meta name="keywords" content="tech, news, gadgets">

- charset="UTF-8" sets the character encoding.  
- viewport ensures responsiveness on different screen sizes.  
- description provides a summary for search engines.  
- keywords help with search engine ranking (though modern SEO relies more on content).  

Mid-Level Engineer Response: 
Meta tags provide essential "metadata" that improves search engine optimization (SEO), social media sharing, and browser behavior. They don’t display content but influence how a page is indexed and rendered.  

Key Meta Tags & Their Uses:  
1. SEO & Search Engine Metadata:
   <meta name="description" content="A blog about AI advancements and software development.">
   - Helps search engines display a relevant snippet in search results.  

2. Viewport Control (Mobile Responsiveness):  
   <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
   - Ensures a webpage adapts to different screen sizes.  
   - Enhances link previews when shared on platforms like Facebook or Twitter.  

4. Character Encoding & Compatibility: 
   <meta charset="UTF-8">
   <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
   - Ensures special characters display correctly and improves browser compatibility.  
By strategically using meta tags, developers optimize page visibility, user experience, and compatibility across devices and platforms.
